Cell Info hierarchy
===================

Service		org.ofono
Interface		org.ofono.NeighborCellInfo
Object path		[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods	aa{sv} AquireMeasurement()
			
			Calling this procedure returns properties of serving
			and neighbouring cells in GSM, WCDMA and LTE networks.
			This information can be used to determine current
			location using triangulation over neighbouring cell
			tower locations and estimated distances.

			This method returns an array that consists of two
			types of cells: 1) first type contains a dictionary of
			common information about network and serving cell for
			a certain radio access type 2) following entries
			contain the measurement results of neighboring cells of
			the same RAT. The contents of the dictionaries
			follow the specification OMA-TS-ULP-V2_0-20100816-C
			for user plane Location and is described in properties
			section.

			Possible errors: org.ofono.Error.Failed
